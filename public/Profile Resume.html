<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    Hello, I'm Reina Horikiri, an aerospace engineering graduate from the University of Surrey. 
    My enthusiasm for engineering stems from a lifetime of air travel, sparking a deep admiration for aircraft and their intricate workings.
</p>
<p>
    During my university experience, I actively engaged in extracurricular activities, taking on roles such as the president of a university society. Organising events, fostering connections, and witnessing community growth became my natural inclination, contributing to an enhanced university experience for fellow students.
</p>
<p>
    With 5 years in hospitality and experience as an apprentice at a renowned HR organisation, I've been inspired to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills. 
    My goal is to contribute to a people-facing profession where I can leverage my technical skills from my engineering degree.
</p>
<p>
    I am eager to explore roles that allow me to blend the worlds of people-facing responsibilities with the technical expertise gained during my studies, fostering growth and making a meaningful impact."
